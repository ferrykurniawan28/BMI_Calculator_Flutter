# bmi_calculator

The app consists of 2 pages for navigation. On the input page, user should choose his/her gender,
then input their height using a Slider Widget, and finally input their weight with the help of 2 buttons. When pressed, the “CALCULATE” button will navigate the user to the result page showing all the calculation result with some messages at the bottom. The “RE-CALCULATE” button will take the user back to the input page.
On the input page there are also security error to prevent user to calculate on invalid gender and height.
